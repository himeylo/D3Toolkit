This can be done through both driver behavior strategies and idle reduction technologies (2). \nDriver behavior strategies to reduce idling: \n-Driver education on how idling reduction strategies can improve local air quality by decreasing vehicle emissions\n-Avoid using remote starters or drive-throughs which encourages unnecessary idling\n-Obey no-idle zone signs in areas with a high proportion of vulnerable individuals, such as near schools or other locations\n-Financial incentives to reward drivers who idle less\n\nIdle reduction technologies (IRT) to reduce emissions: \n-Stop-start vehicle technology \n-GPS tracking software \n-Auxiliary power systems \n-Air heaters \n-Automatic power management systems \n-Waste-heat recovery systems \n-Hybridization or electrification of vehicles \n\nAdditionally, making infrastructure modifications in areas with vulnerable populations can reduce vehicle idling by improving the flow of traffic and preventing unnecessary stops and starts. One example of a road modification is implementing roundabouts at intersections instead of four-way stops.",

One way to do this is to ban the most polluting vehicles from some or all roads in the LEZ, requiring cities to establish vehicle standards to determine which vehicles would be allowed to enter the zone. A more extensive approach would be to implement a ZEZ that only allows zero-emitting vehicles (including electric vehicles), pedestrians, and cyclists to use the roads in the zone (2). However, there are some exceptions regarding who is not allowed to pass through LEZs and ZEZs, including low-income or disabled drivers, individuals who live within the zone, public transit, and emergency vehicles (3).",

The steps necessary for traffic control must be outlined in a traffic management plan (7). At its most basic level, urban traffic control is accomplished by employing a system of signs, signals, and markings. To ensure that the traffic control devices provide motorists with a clear and straightforward message, sophisticated technical requirements are applied (8). Numerous safety advantages may be obtained by safely and efficiently managing traffic, including a considerable reduction in car crashes (9).",

This can allow companies to reduce their carbon footprint by being able to lease less office space and reduce commuting hours (2). Additionally, promoting flexible in-person working hours—as an alternative to the typical 9am to 5pm work day—can decrease the number of commuters at peak traffic times and reduce congestion (3).",

This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

It is a cost-effective substitute for buses and shuttles and a versatile and environmentally friendly mode of 'last-mile' transportation for students, staff, and employees. It can be used to link essential destinations like parking lots or public transportation stops to central places, or it can be utilized to help students move on and off-campus more easily. Unlike shuttle services, bike sharing can be accessed at any time (2). Either docked or dockless, bike share programs are typically now supported with technology that facilitates rental payment and monitoring/maintenance of the bicycles (3).\n\nImplementing bike sharing programs can potentially reduce transportation emissions and urban noise levels by encouraging more individuals to switch from cars to bikes. Although the impact on vehicle emissions for bike share systems alone is minimal, this solution can be combined with other approaches—such as constructing safe bicycle infrastructure—to prompt users to ditch their personal vehicles (4). Additionally, zero-emitting, electrically assisted bikes can help individuals lessen their carbon footprint by not contributing to overall urban pollution (5).",

Like transit-oriented development, it emphasizes active forms of transportation to encourage less personal vehicle use and decrease vehicle miles traveled. On the other hand, incomplete streets tend to favor car use since it makes it less convenient for road users to walk, bike, or use public transit, therefore resulting in community severance. While traditional road development focuses on vehicle movement and flow, zoning reforms utilizing the Complete Streets concept emphasizes the movement and connectivity of all road users. \n\nComplete Streets components can include:\n-Narrower vehicle lane widths and traffic calming measures to foster a safe environment for pedestrians\n-Improved and accessible crosswalks with appropriate signals\n-Buffered pedestrian and bicycle lanes from vehicle traffic",

Therefore, new vehicles being developed would be required to have higher fuel and energy efficiency levels. Under the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) can set forth policies to regulate motor vehicle emissions. In December 2021, the EPA announced its newest emissions standards that will apply to passenger vehicles and light-trucks with model years 2023-2026 (2, 3). One of the rules will also require passenger vehicles to reach a fuel efficiency level of 55 miles per gallon of gasoline by 2026.

It creates a highly connected community that connects residents to essential destinations without the need of a personal vehicle. It also results in less traffic and parking congestion and encourages the use of public transit. This strategy can be accompanied with Complete Streets designs, transit-oriented development, and bike sharing programs to shift further away from motorized-centered approaches in transportation. \n\nExpanding bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure can include modifications such as:\n-Wide bicycle lanes and sidewalks with adequate separation from vehicular traffic\n-Bike parking and storage infrastructure (including bike sharing stations)\n-Safe, signalized intersections and crossings for pedestrians and bicyclists\n-Pedestrian overpasses and underpasses to prevent the need to cross roads\n-Barriers or medians (including green infrastructure options) to separate active and motorized transportation\n-High-visibility signage for pedestrians and bicyclists\n-Shared-use paths that are ADA accessible\n\nState and local governments can also create a focused Active Transportation Program to increase investment towards solutions that prioritize walking and biking infrastructure (2). Focused program administration can maximize the resources towards creating a pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly built environment that allows users to safely reach their essential destinations.",

          "description": "The construction industry is one of the highest contributors to pollution with a significant carbon footprint (1). The harmful environmental impacts from construction activities largely result from diesel emissions from construction equipment (2). Although there are regulations pertaining to construction equipment standards, outdated and high-emitting equipment is still in use. In 2019, the building and construction industries accounted for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions (3). Additionally, it is estimated that transport within construction projects accounts for approximately 10% of carbon dioxide emissions (4). \n\nFortunately, there are actions that contractors and construction companies can take to reduce their carbon footprint including: (2, 5, 6)\n-Idle-reduction practices, especially for large equipment that burns a lot of fuel\n-Using local construction materials to reduce emissions from material transport\n-Using cleaner, alternative fuels and upgrading construction equipment to reduce emissions\n\nConstruction sites can also account for a significant portion of polluted stormwater runoff, so construction site operators should ensure that the site is preserving erosion impacts and water quality throughout the duration of the project (7).\n\nConstruction-related noise pollution is another concern among construction workers since it can eventually lead to a loss of hearing and other health effects. However, there are a number of actions that construction companies can take to protect their workers and the surrounding environment (8, 9). Some of these noise controls include:\n-Choosing low-noise machinery with sound-absorbing materials\n-Implement equipment muffler requirements\n-Operate noisy machinery when fewer workers are on-site\n-Add noise barriers between the noise and the worker\n-Offer hearing protection, such as ear plugs, for workers\n-Provide quiet areas for workers during breaks\n-Incorporate complaint mechanisms for workers and the community",

This is similar to transit-oriented development practices, in which cities are designed to be more pedestrian-oriented and discourage single occupant vehicle trips by introducing car-free centers. A car-free center is a location where the population of the city center primarily uses forms of public transportation or walking in replace of car travel (2). The infrastructure of the location does not support large motor vehicle traffic and makes it difficult for drivers to get around the city, thus promoting cycling and walking (3). Vehicle restrictions can be specific to the type of vehicle, such as permitting only certain types of vehicles from entering the street. This strategy is most applicable in dense urban regions and commercial centers.",

          "description": "Route planning tools can be a valuable solution to cutting down vehicle emissions and reducing road users' exposure to harmful pollutants. Fleet managers and public transit operators can utilize route planning software to calculate the most efficient routes to decrease travel time, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (1). In addition, this can improve business operations and increase profit margins for these companies (2).\n\nMobile route planning tools can be utilized by pedestrians and bicyclists to identify the best routes, in terms of safety, trip duration, air quality, and noise levels. Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

          "description": "Parking standards, including parking maximums and minimums, refer to policy decisions regarding the amount of parking that is required for new developments during land use planning (1). Many cities have parking requirements within zoning codes that establish a minimum number of off-street parking spaces to meet the specific development's demands (2). The purpose is to ensure that there is enough off-street parking available for each development, without vehicles being forced to park in other lots and creating more traffic. \n\nAs more people have become dependent on cars, the demand for curbside or on-street parking has increased, and the solution has been to implement zoning requirements for off-street parking (3). Unfortunately, this can limit the space that is available for pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, public transit, and green space. Parking minimums can also lead to increased local vehicle emissions and traffic noise from discouraging alternative forms of transportation and leading to urban sprawl, a form of rapid low-density development (4). Reducing minimum parking requirements and, instead, establishing parking maximums and removing off-street parking requirements can promote compact development, prevent underutilized parking lots, and can allow the land to be used for other purposes (5).",

          "description": "Compact cities refers to urban plans that are related to a much more densely populated occupancy with multiple uses (such as households, businesses, and activities) and the encouragement of pedestrian, cycling, and public transportation-user mobility (1). Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

Around the globe, traffic calming has established itself as a tried-and-true component of sustainable urban mobility management. Although traffic calming originated in Europe, it is now a common practice in the U.S. (3). \n\nTraffic calming measures serve several purposes, including lowering fast-moving vehicle speeds to reduce the risk of potential accidents on the road, balancing different modes of traffic due to slower speeding, minimizing noise levels, and improving air quality. They also increase safety and reduce the number of accidents, lessen the need for police enforcement, and improve accessibility for various modes of transportation (4).",

Implementing safer infrastructure like bike lanes and sidewalks will make people feel more comfortable walking and riding to their destinations. Since bicyclists and pedestrians are at risk on the road because they have little to no protection in the event of a crash, enhancing their safety is essential for transit agencies and local governments (2). Different parameters such as traffic reduction, speed reduction, junction treatments, redistribution of road space, and the creation of special facilities are considered to be measures used to create safer conditions for pedestrians and cyclists (3).",

In poor neighborhoods dependent on transit, people can experience isolation from other parts of their community or much-needed goods and services if those amenities are too far away to walk to, or if transit is too expensive (1).\nThis can include providing vouchers to a specific population which allows them to take public or private transportation for free or at a reduced cost (2). The strategy also offers mileage reimbursements to support participating members who drive their own vehicle or are unable to find friends or family to take them to their various medical emergency or non-emergency appointments (3). The target population includes those who could not access transportation due to physical disabilities, old age, a medical condition, or financial constraints. With the voucher, participants either pay less or or take a ride for free while the transportaion provider gets reimbursed by the funding sponsor. A voucher system allows users to chose transportation service to match their needs. It allows them to chose the type of vehicle, time and day, type of service (e.g. door-to-door, public buses, taxis, etc.), thereby mitigating traditional transportation barriers.",

This is usually accomplished by arranging the site and mix of land uses to accommodate public transportation. This approach can include multimodal connection planning such as treating existing rail stations and transit stations as nodal hubs for pedestrian, bicycle, micro-mobility and other active transportation modes. It also includes mixed-use development offering non-residential services and amenities in walking distance to home, work, school and transit. Compared to other areas, community members surrounding by this form of land use will travel less by personal vehicle, thereby reducing the health effects associated with vehicle overburden. Similarly, employees in such locations are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation to go to work and do lunchtime errands on foot or by bicycle. These variables may result in more significant public transportation commuting, increased non-motorized travel for non-commuting excursions (such as shopping and school visits), and decreased vehicle travel (2).",

          "description": "Improving road traffic flow through road infrastructure remodeling efforts can significantly reduce congestion, vehicle idling, emissions, and noise levels (1-4). Traffic flow can be optimized through various road design techniques such as: (5)\n-Adding more vehicle lanes to congested roadways\n-Converting intersections to roundabouts to help allow free traffic flow\n-Interchange layouts to direct traffic to other roads\n-Traffic light synchronization\n\nUrban traffic control (UTC) is a specialized traffic management method that lessens the effect of stop times on vulnerable road users by coordinating traffic signals in a centralized area (6). The steps necessary for traffic control must be outlined in a traffic management plan (7). At its most basic level, urban traffic control is accomplished by employing a system of signs, signals, and markings. To ensure that the traffic control devices provide motorists with a clear and straightforward message, sophisticated technical requirements are applied (8). Numerous safety advantages may be obtained by safely and efficiently managing traffic, including a considerable reduction in car crashes (9).",

This can allow companies to reduce their carbon footprint by being able to lease less office space and reduce commuting hours (2).

          "description": "Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban planning strategy that mixes residential and commercial development to create walkable, high-density, mixed-use environments (1, 2). This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

It is a cost-effective substitute for buses and shuttles and a versatile and environmentally friendly mode of 'last-mile' transportation for students, staff, and employees. It can be used to link essential destinations like parking lots or public transportation stops to central places, or it can be utilized to help students move on and off-campus more easily. Unlike shuttle services, bike sharing can be accessed at any time (2). Either docked or dockless, bike share programs are typically now supported with technology that facilitates rental payment and monitoring/maintenance of the bicycles (3).\n\nImplementing bike sharing programs can potentially reduce transportation emissions and urban noise levels by encouraging more individuals to switch from cars to bikes. Although the impact on vehicle emissions for bike share systems alone is minimal, this solution can be combined with other approaches—such as constructing safe bicycle infrastructure—to prompt users to ditch their personal vehicles (4). Additionally, zero-emitting, electrically assisted bikes can help individuals lessen their carbon footprint by not contributing to overall urban pollution (5).",

It creates a highly connected community that connects residents to essential destinations without the need of a personal vehicle. It also results in less traffic and parking congestion and encourages the use of public transit. This strategy can be accompanied with Complete Streets designs, transit-oriented development, and bike sharing programs to shift further away from motorized-centered approaches in transportation. \n\nExpanding bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure can include modifications such as:\n-Wide bicycle lanes and sidewalks with adequate separation from vehicular traffic\n-Bike parking and storage infrastructure (including bike sharing stations)\n-Safe, signalized intersections and crossings for pedestrians and bicyclists\n-Pedestrian overpasses and underpasses to prevent the need to cross roads\n-Barriers or medians (including green infrastructure options) to separate active and motorized transportation\n-High-visibility signage for pedestrians and bicyclists\n-Shared-use paths that are ADA accessible\n\nState and local governments can also create a focused Active Transportation Program to increase investment towards solutions that prioritize walking and biking infrastructure (2). Focused program administration can maximize the resources towards creating a pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly built environment that allows users to safely reach their essential destinations.",

Fleet managers and public transit operators can utilize route planning software to calculate the most efficient routes to decrease travel time, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (1). In addition, this can improve business operations and increase profit margins for these companies (2).\n\nMobile route planning tools can be utilized by pedestrians and bicyclists to identify the best routes, in terms of safety, trip duration, air quality, and noise levels. Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

          "description": "Compact cities refers to urban plans that are related to a much more densely populated occupancy with multiple uses (such as households, businesses, and activities) and the encouragement of pedestrian, cycling, and public transportation-user mobility (1). Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

In poor neighborhoods dependent on transit, people can experience isolation from other parts of their community or much-needed goods and services if those amenities are too far away to walk to, or if transit is too expensive (1).\nThis can include providing vouchers to a specific population which allows them to take public or private transportation for free or at a reduced cost (2). The strategy also offers mileage reimbursements to support participating members who drive their own vehicle or are unable to find friends or family to take them to their various medical emergency or non-emergency appointments (3). The target population includes those who could not access transportation due to physical disabilities, old age, a medical condition, or financial constraints. With the voucher, participants either pay less or or take a ride for free while the transportaion provider gets reimbursed by the funding sponsor. A voucher system allows users to chose transportation service to match their needs. It allows them to chose the type of vehicle, time and day, type of service (e.g. door-to-door, public buses, taxis, etc.), thereby mitigating traditional transportation barriers.",

This is usually accomplished by arranging the site and mix of land uses to accommodate public transportation. This approach can include multimodal connection planning such as treating existing rail stations and transit stations as nodal hubs for pedestrian, bicycle, micro-mobility and other active transportation modes. It also includes mixed-use development offering non-residential services and amenities in walking distance to home, work, school and transit. Compared to other areas, community members surrounding by this form of land use will travel less by personal vehicle, thereby reducing the health effects associated with vehicle overburden. Similarly, employees in such locations are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation to go to work and do lunchtime errands on foot or by bicycle. These variables may result in more significant public transportation commuting, increased non-motorized travel for non-commuting excursions (such as shopping and school visits), and decreased vehicle travel (2).",

This gives the user peace of mind in knowing if and when their bus will show up. This information is available via a website and mobile app (iOS and Android), as well as digital screens in public and commercial locations, with the goal of increasing bus usage and reducing private automobile trips (2).",

          "description": "Edge lane roads (ELRs)—also known as an advisory bike lane or advisory shoulder (1)—is a road structure that accommodates two-way motor vehicle and vulnerable road user traffic by utilizing a central travel lane and edge lanes. The center lane is designated for and shared by cars heading in both directions. Vulnerable road users have the right of way in the edge lanes; however, moving vehicles may enter the edge lanes to pass vulnerable road users after yielding to approaching moving vehicles (2). The car lane lacks a center line and is often broader than usual but not big enough to accommodate two vehicles. Instead, when vehicles meet, they temporarily occupy one of the edge lanes to negotiate space. ELRs are particularly beneficial on narrow roads for regular bike lanes or sidewalks. These affordable solutions have the potential to enhance the safety of the most vulnerable road users, therefore decreasing collisions and enhancing the nation's transportation system. (3).",

          "description": "Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban planning strategy that mixes residential and commercial development to create walkable, high-density, mixed-use environments (1, 2). This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

          "description": "Bike sharing systems has received considerable attention as a sustainable mode of transportation to meet the increasing travel demand of urban residents (1). It is a cost-effective substitute for buses and shuttles and a versatile and environmentally friendly mode of 'last-mile' transportation for students, staff, and employees. It can be used to link essential destinations like parking lots or public transportation stops to central places, or it can be utilized to help students move on and off-campus more easily. Unlike shuttle services, bike sharing can be accessed at any time (2). Either docked or dockless, bike share programs are typically now supported with technology that facilitates rental payment and monitoring/maintenance of the bicycles (3).\n\nImplementing bike sharing programs can potentially reduce transportation emissions and urban noise levels by encouraging more individuals to switch from cars to bikes. Although the impact on vehicle emissions for bike share systems alone is minimal, this solution can be combined with other approaches—such as constructing safe bicycle infrastructure—to prompt users to ditch their personal vehicles (4). Additionally, zero-emitting, electrically assisted bikes can help individuals lessen their carbon footprint by not contributing to overall urban pollution (5).",

Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

          "description": "Compact cities refers to urban plans that are related to a much more densely populated occupancy with multiple uses (such as households, businesses, and activities) and the encouragement of pedestrian, cycling, and public transportation-user mobility (1). Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

In poor neighborhoods dependent on transit, people can experience isolation from other parts of their community or much-needed goods and services if those amenities are too far away to walk to, or if transit is too expensive (1).\nThis can include providing vouchers to a specific population which allows them to take public or private transportation for free or at a reduced cost (2). The strategy also offers mileage reimbursements to support participating members who drive their own vehicle or are unable to find friends or family to take them to their various medical emergency or non-emergency appointments (3). The target population includes those who could not access transportation due to physical disabilities, old age, a medical condition, or financial constraints. With the voucher, participants either pay less or or take a ride for free while the transportaion provider gets reimbursed by the funding sponsor. A voucher system allows users to chose transportation service to match their needs. It allows them to chose the type of vehicle, time and day, type of service (e.g. door-to-door, public buses, taxis, etc.), thereby mitigating traditional transportation barriers.",

          "description": "Land use for public transit entails implementing new land development practices and managing existing land in order to: (1)\n- Improve conditions for a good public transportation operation\n- Enable access to urban areas  \n- Encourage people to travel more by alternative modes of transportation (including biking and walking)\n- Increase availability and accessibility to transportation\n\nPublic transportation modes, such as rail and bus stations, may act as a catalyst for more accessible land use by establishing pedestrian- and cyclist-oriented areas. This is usually accomplished by arranging the site and mix of land uses to accommodate public transportation. This approach can include multimodal connection planning such as treating existing rail stations and transit stations as nodal hubs for pedestrian, bicycle, micro-mobility and other active transportation modes. It also includes mixed-use development offering non-residential services and amenities in walking distance to home, work, school and transit. Compared to other areas, community members surrounding by this form of land use will travel less by personal vehicle, thereby reducing the health effects associated with vehicle overburden. Similarly, employees in such locations are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation to go to work and do lunchtime errands on foot or by bicycle. These variables may result in more significant public transportation commuting, increased non-motorized travel for non-commuting excursions (such as shopping and school visits), and decreased vehicle travel (2).",

          "description": "Edge lane roads (ELRs)—also known as an advisory bike lane or advisory shoulder (1)—is a road structure that accommodates two-way motor vehicle and vulnerable road user traffic by utilizing a central travel lane and edge lanes. The center lane is designated for and shared by cars heading in both directions. Vulnerable road users have the right of way in the edge lanes; however, moving vehicles may enter the edge lanes to pass vulnerable road users after yielding to approaching moving vehicles (2). The car lane lacks a center line and is often broader than usual but not big enough to accommodate two vehicles. Instead, when vehicles meet, they temporarily occupy one of the edge lanes to negotiate space. ELRs are particularly beneficial on narrow roads for regular bike lanes or sidewalks. These affordable solutions have the potential to enhance the safety of the most vulnerable road users, therefore decreasing collisions and enhancing the nation's transportation system. (3).",

This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

It is a cost-effective substitute for buses and shuttles and a versatile and environmentally friendly mode of 'last-mile' transportation for students, staff, and employees. It can be used to link essential destinations like parking lots or public transportation stops to central places, or it can be utilized to help students move on and off-campus more easily. Unlike shuttle services, bike sharing can be accessed at any time (2). Either docked or dockless, bike share programs are typically now supported with technology that facilitates rental payment and monitoring/maintenance of the bicycles (3).\n\nImplementing bike sharing programs can potentially reduce transportation emissions and urban noise levels by encouraging more individuals to switch from cars to bikes. Although the impact on vehicle emissions for bike share systems alone is minimal, this solution can be combined with other approaches—such as constructing safe bicycle infrastructure—to prompt users to ditch their personal vehicles (4). Additionally, zero-emitting, electrically assisted bikes can help individuals lessen their carbon footprint by not contributing to overall urban pollution (5).",

A car-free center is a location where the population of the city center primarily uses forms of public transportation or walking in replace of car travel (2). The infrastructure of the location does not support large motor vehicle traffic and makes it difficult for drivers to get around the city, thus promoting cycling and walking (3).

Fleet managers and public transit operators can utilize route planning software to calculate the most efficient routes to decrease travel time, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (1). In addition, this can improve business operations and increase profit margins for these companies (2).\n\nMobile route planning tools can be utilized by pedestrians and bicyclists to identify the best routes, in terms of safety, trip duration, air quality, and noise levels. Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

Many cities have parking requirements within zoning codes that establish a minimum number of off-street parking spaces to meet the specific development's demands (2). The purpose is to ensure that there is enough off-street parking available for each development, without vehicles being forced to park in other lots and creating more traffic. \n\nAs more people have become dependent on cars, the demand for curbside or on-street parking has increased, and the solution has been to implement zoning requirements for off-street parking (3). Unfortunately, this can limit the space that is available for pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, public transit, and green space. Parking minimums can also lead to increased local vehicle emissions and traffic noise from discouraging alternative forms of transportation and leading to urban sprawl, a form of rapid low-density development (4). Reducing minimum parking requirements and, instead, establishing parking maximums and removing off-street parking requirements can promote compact development, prevent underutilized parking lots, and can allow the land to be used for other purposes (5).",

Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

Around the globe, traffic calming has established itself as a tried-and-true component of sustainable urban mobility management. Although traffic calming originated in Europe, it is now a common practice in the U.S. (3). \n\nTraffic calming measures serve several purposes, including lowering fast-moving vehicle speeds to reduce the risk of potential accidents on the road, balancing different modes of traffic due to slower speeding, minimizing noise levels, and improving air quality. They also increase safety and reduce the number of accidents, lessen the need for police enforcement, and improve accessibility for various modes of transportation (4).",

This is usually accomplished by arranging the site and mix of land uses to accommodate public transportation. This approach can include multimodal connection planning such as treating existing rail stations and transit stations as nodal hubs for pedestrian, bicycle, micro-mobility and other active transportation modes. It also includes mixed-use development offering non-residential services and amenities in walking distance to home, work, school and transit. Compared to other areas, community members surrounding by this form of land use will travel less by personal vehicle, thereby reducing the health effects associated with vehicle overburden. Similarly, employees in such locations are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation to go to work and do lunchtime errands on foot or by bicycle. These variables may result in more significant public transportation commuting, increased non-motorized travel for non-commuting excursions (such as shopping and school visits), and decreased vehicle travel (2).",

The center lane is designated for and shared by cars heading in both directions. Vulnerable road users have the right of way in the edge lanes; however, moving vehicles may enter the edge lanes to pass vulnerable road users after yielding to approaching moving vehicles (2). The car lane lacks a center line and is often broader than usual but not big enough to accommodate two vehicles. Instead, when vehicles meet, they temporarily occupy one of the edge lanes to negotiate space. ELRs are particularly beneficial on narrow roads for regular bike lanes or sidewalks. These affordable solutions have the potential to enhance the safety of the most vulnerable road users, therefore decreasing collisions and enhancing the nation's transportation system. (3).",

This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4).

Many cities have parking requirements within zoning codes that establish a minimum number of off-street parking spaces to meet the specific development's demands (2). The purpose is to ensure that there is enough off-street parking available for each development, without vehicles being forced to park in other lots and creating more traffic. \n\nAs more people have become dependent on cars, the demand for curbside or on-street parking has increased, and the solution has been to implement zoning requirements for off-street parking (3). Unfortunately, this can limit the space that is available for pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, public transit, and green space. Parking minimums can also lead to increased local vehicle emissions and traffic noise from discouraging alternative forms of transportation and leading to urban sprawl, a form of rapid low-density development (4). Reducing minimum parking requirements and, instead, establishing parking maximums and removing off-street parking requirements can promote compact development, prevent underutilized parking lots, and can allow the land to be used for other purposes (5).",

This structure is usually a U-shaped depression that can be natural or constructed and used in either rural or urban areas. In addition, grassed waterways can provide shelter and food for wildlife and greatly improve landscape aesthetics.\n\nTrees, shrubs, and other groundcover can manage stormwater runoff due to their capacity to intercept and store rainwater (3, 4). Trees can improve soil infiltration, thereby decreasing the amount of pollutants in runoff that eventually reach local waters.\n\nRain gardens are another example of 'green infrastructure' designs that can collect stormwater runoff from driveways, streets, or sidewalks (5, 6).

In 2019, the building and construction industries accounted for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions (3). Additionally, it is estimated that transport within construction projects accounts for approximately 10% of carbon dioxide emissions (4). \n\nFortunately, there are actions that contractors and construction companies can take to reduce their carbon footprint including: (2, 5, 6)\n-Idle-reduction practices, especially for large equipment that burns a lot of fuel\n-Using local construction materials to reduce emissions from material transport\n-Using cleaner, alternative fuels and upgrading construction equipment to reduce emissions\n\nConstruction sites can also account for a significant portion of polluted stormwater runoff, so construction site operators should ensure that the site is preserving erosion impacts and water quality throughout the duration of the project (7).\n\nConstruction-related noise pollution is another concern among construction workers since it can eventually lead to a loss of hearing and other health effects. However, there are a number of actions that construction companies can take to protect their workers and the surrounding environment (8, 9). Some of these noise controls include:\n-Choosing low-noise machinery with sound-absorbing materials\n-Implement equipment muffler requirements\n-Operate noisy machinery when fewer workers are on-site\n-Add noise barriers between the noise and the worker\n-Offer hearing protection, such as ear plugs, for workers\n-Provide quiet areas for workers during breaks\n-Incorporate complaint mechanisms for workers and the community",

A car-free center is a location where the population of the city center primarily uses forms of public transportation or walking in replace of car travel (2). The infrastructure of the location does not support large motor vehicle traffic and makes it difficult for drivers to get around the city, thus promoting cycling and walking (3).

Although curbs and gutters can efficiently move excess water into the storm drain system, this design does not allow for pollutant removal or efficient filtration through porous structures. Therefore, future designs should consider replacing curbs and gutters with solutions such as curb cuts and green infrastructure. \n\nCurb cuts are where portions of the curb have been cut out and modified to allow for the passage of water from the street to an inlet before it enters the storm sewer (3). It can be thought of as a water bypass system where excess runoff is collected and directed to more permeable surfaces.\n\nGreen infrastructure alternatives to curbs and gutters include swales, bioretention systems, or permeable pavement (4). Grassed or vegetative swales is a common stormwater practice that collects and infiltrates the runoff from roadways (5). Swales are similar to shallow ditches on either side of the roadway and are especially appropriate in low- to medium-density development areas.",

Since many urban and suburban areas are largely covered by concrete and other impervious surfaces where water is not absorbed, these areas rely on storm drains to carry runoff into nearby waterways (2). Unfortunately, if garbage and other debris is not disposed of properly, it can end up in storm drains, streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans where it is referred to as 'aquatic trash' (3). This can result in negative environmental, social, and economic impacts by polluting the water and harming aquatic ecosystems. \n\nThere are a series of best management practices (BMPs) that are used to protect water quality and manage stormwater pollution (4). One example is public education and outreach efforts to prevent or control litter. In additional to educational interventions, there are other ways to reduce litter in communities such as: (5)\n-Developing volunteer programs, such as Adopt-a-Street, where schools, nonprofits, and other community members can pick up trash\n-Enforce litter laws through laws, fines, penalties, or incentives\n-Introduce a litter tax where the funds can be used to develop educational campaigns",

          "description": "Permeable pavements can be used as a stormwater management approach, and examples may include pervious concrete, porous asphalt, concrete grid pavement, or several others (1). These designs allow for runoff reduction by allowing for slow infiltration into the top layer and then into the underlying layers of soil and gravel (2, 3). Permeable pavement usually consists of an underlying stone reservoir that temporarily stores runoff as it infiltrates into the soil. Conventional, impermeable pavement surfaces force rainwater to run off much faster without absorbing into nearby soil (4). Alternatively, permeable surfaces can reduce runoff pollution by filtering out harmful substances before entering stormwater collection systems and nearby streams.\n\nAdditionally, reducing directly connected impervious areas (DCIA) with permeable pavements or other green infrastructure designs can lower the accumulation of pollutants on impermeable surfaces and improve water quality (5). Roadways, parking lots, and other impervious structures prevent infiltration and can contribute to flooding.",

A retention (wet) basin has a permanent pool of water, while a detention (dry) basin is not always full with water. \n\nDetention ponds hold runoff for a short period of time, typically after a rain storm, and remain dry between storms. Dry detention ponds reduce runoff velocity and allows the water to be slowly released from the basin in order to prevent flooding. However, detention ponds do not typically improve water quality as well as retention ponds.\n\nRetention ponds maintain a pool of water and hold excess runoff following storms.

Filtration systems are designed to remove suspended sediments by passing water through porous media filters—often consisting of sand, soil, or gravel—or vegetative filters like grassed swales (1-3). These systems have widespread applicability; however, filtration systems are less effective when capturing finer solids such as highway runoff pollutants (4).\n\nInfiltration systems work by temporarily storing runoff, before allowing it to infiltrate into the ground (4). Stormwater infiltration allows for pollutant removal, slows runoff velocity, and decreases the volume of runoff (5, 6). Examples of infiltration designs include detention basins, underground infiltration systems, permeable pavements, and infiltration trenches (7).",

Wastes generated by transportation-related activities can include lead-contaminated materials, acids and other solvents, pesticides, or garbage and other debris.\n\nIt has been found that the transportation sector frequently encounters hazardous waste, and there are a number of strategies that can be utilized to manage this waste in transportation-related projects (1, 2). Some of these practices include:\n-Identify the types and quantity of hazardous materials that may be encountered\n-Perform proper, site-specific risk assessments\n-Consider the need to transfer hazardous materials to disposal sites\n-Evaluate the impact of hazardous waste generation on surrounding communities and the environment\n-Periodically review and keep up-to-date on waste management requirements to ensure compliance\n-Develop project plans that incorporate recycling and reuse opportunities\n-Reduce the use of nonrenewable resources and promote the use of renewable replacements",

With fewer employees commuting to offices every day, this reduces the number of cars on the road and decreases vehicle miles travelled (VMT) per capita and vehicle emissions. This can allow companies to reduce their carbon footprint by being able to lease less office space and reduce commuting hours (2). Additionally, promoting flexible in-person working hours—as an alternative to the typical 9am to 5pm work day—can decrease the number of commuters at peak traffic times and reduce congestion (3).",

          "description": "Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban planning strategy that mixes residential and commercial development to create walkable, high-density, mixed-use environments (1, 2). This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

          "description": "Vehicle restrictions are a type of regulatory strategy to limit vehicle travel on certain roads and time of day (1). This is similar to transit-oriented development practices, in which cities are designed to be more pedestrian-oriented and discourage single occupant vehicle trips by introducing car-free centers. A car-free center is a location where the population of the city center primarily uses forms of public transportation or walking in replace of car travel (2). The infrastructure of the location does not support large motor vehicle traffic and makes it difficult for drivers to get around the city, thus promoting cycling and walking (3). Vehicle restrictions can be specific to the type of vehicle, such as permitting only certain types of vehicles from entering the street. This strategy is most applicable in dense urban regions and commercial centers.",

Fleet managers and public transit operators can utilize route planning software to calculate the most efficient routes to decrease travel time, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (1). In addition, this can improve business operations and increase profit margins for these companies (2).\n\nMobile route planning tools can be utilized by pedestrians and bicyclists to identify the best routes, in terms of safety, trip duration, air quality, and noise levels. Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

These measures include the installation of neckdowns, speed tables, speed bumps, roundabouts, and other traffic control devices (2). Around the globe, traffic calming has established itself as a tried-and-true component of sustainable urban mobility management. Although traffic calming originated in Europe, it is now a common practice in the U.S. (3). \n\nTraffic calming measures serve several purposes, including lowering fast-moving vehicle speeds to reduce the risk of potential accidents on the road, balancing different modes of traffic due to slower speeding, minimizing noise levels, and improving air quality. They also increase safety and reduce the number of accidents, lessen the need for police enforcement, and improve accessibility for various modes of transportation (4).",

This can be done by leveraging creative and efficient collaborations, tools, and initiatives to avoid, mitigate, share data, and respond to these issues (1). This approach can include improved transit driver training, newer vehicles, better station designs, and increased separation between transit vehicles and road users (2). Particularly in developing nations, public transportation has resulted in a significant risk to safety and security due to the lack of a suitable and integrated approach (3).",

It looks beyond the fact that humans make errors, which could cost loss of lives; however, it agrees that the road transportation system should be able to account for human shortcomings and tolerate mistakes in order to minimize deaths and severe injuries. The approach considers all road users to be a driving mechanism for change to reduce road accidents; hence, they must comply with the basic safety rules (2).",

This simple safety device prevents vulnerable road users from being trapped and crushed by the truck’s rear wheel (1). However, the requirements of this guard ensure that the ground clearance for the front underride guard is no more than 400mm; while the ground clearance for the underride guard is between 450mm and 500mm, the side protection system requires a 300mm maximum ground clearnace (2). Adopting these requirements will successfully guard vehicles from crashing on heavy vehicles (trucks), and as a result, the severe injuries caused by accidents between heavy trucks and vulnerable road users would be reduced (3).",

The center lane is designated for and shared by cars heading in both directions. Vulnerable road users have the right of way in the edge lanes; however, moving vehicles may enter the edge lanes to pass vulnerable road users after yielding to approaching moving vehicles (2). The car lane lacks a center line and is often broader than usual but not big enough to accommodate two vehicles. Instead, when vehicles meet, they temporarily occupy one of the edge lanes to negotiate space. ELRs are particularly beneficial on narrow roads for regular bike lanes or sidewalks. These affordable solutions have the potential to enhance the safety of the most vulnerable road users, therefore decreasing collisions and enhancing the nation's transportation system. (3).",

New motorists' driving privileges are initially limited under the program. These limits are usually lifted in three phases as the individuals develop driving expertise and experience. A learner's stage or permit is the first of these phases, followed by an intermediate stage, and a full privilege stage or license (2). \n\nThe learner's stage enables anyone under 15 to get a permit after completing a written test. Before receiving an intermediate license, the Intermediate State requires applicants between the ages of 16 and 18 to complete driving lessons and pass a driving test. After passing the first two stages, individuals who are 18 years or older are granted a class C license at the privilege stage (3). It has been shown that the system reduces adolescent collisions and fatalities by assisting novice drivers in developing their abilities in lower-risk environments (4).",

Vehicles, vulnerable road users, animals, and other structures influence our roadways, and their many interactions may cause accidents (2).\n\nMost road users are fairly aware of the basic safety precautions and laws that apply while using the roads; however, accidents and wrecks only occur due to road users' negligence (3). Regardless of the circumstance, this strategy strives to provide appropriate traffic guidance and control technologies to direct road users and guarantee the secure flow of vehicles (4). The commitment and coordination of management, safety programs, safety culture, and responsibility are necessary to implement this strategy (1).",

          "description": "Increased resilience of the transportation system refers to the implementation of strategies to strengthen the transportation infrastructure. The transportation network can face several obstacles including severe weather events, major accidents, and equipment or infrastructure failures (1). Increasing the resilience of the transportation system will strengthen the transport network and provide the capability for the transport system to recover from any disruption (2). This strategy is usually implemented by creating a framework to improve the resiliency of the transportation infrastructure systems (3). Based on this framework, the transportation system is balanced and prepared based on four detailed parameters; (i) Robustness, (ii) Redundancy, (iii) Resourcefulness, and (iv) Rapidity (4). Firstly, the robustness of the transportation system is upgraded to withstand obstacles and disruptions. Secondly, the impacts on the transportation system are kept to a minimum when redundancy is provided since a disruption will be compensated for. Thirdly, appropriate organizations will react and mobilize the required resources if a disruption occurs. Finally, after considering several possible outcomes, the system can react and swiftly recover (4).",

The steps necessary for traffic control must be outlined in a traffic management plan (7). At its most basic level, urban traffic control is accomplished by employing a system of signs, signals, and markings. To ensure that the traffic control devices provide motorists with a clear and straightforward message, sophisticated technical requirements are applied (8). Numerous safety advantages may be obtained by safely and efficiently managing traffic, including a considerable reduction in car crashes (9).",

This can allow companies to reduce their carbon footprint by being able to lease less office space and reduce commuting hours (2).

This results in a shift from a more automobile-centered urban environment to one that is more pedestrian and transit friendly. Bringing housing, jobs and commerce closer together so that people can live a greater portion of their lives in their community is a major component of this approach. It also means location-efficient development, where affordable housing, employment and public facilities are located in accessible areas. Accessible neighborhoods may be walkable and have robust transit access, so that local governments can reduce parking needs for citizens in these neighborhoods that own fewer than average vehicles. TOD focuses on combatting the problems associated with traffic congestion, urban sprawl, and single-use development. \n\nSome of the components and benefits of TOD include:\n-Emphasizing a walkable design with pedestrians at the center of efforts\n-Well-connected streets with mixed land use patterns (including office, residential, and retail spaces)\n-Easily accessible and more compact public transit stations\n-Reduced parking space availability in certain areas to discourage vehicle use\n-Permitting only certain vehicle types (ex: low-emitting vehicles) to use certain roads",

It is a cost-effective substitute for buses and shuttles and a versatile and environmentally friendly mode of 'last-mile' transportation for students, staff, and employees. It can be used to link essential destinations like parking lots or public transportation stops to central places, or it can be utilized to help students move on and off-campus more easily. Unlike shuttle services, bike sharing can be accessed at any time (2). Either docked or dockless, bike share programs are typically now supported with technology that facilitates rental payment and monitoring/maintenance of the bicycles (3).\n\nImplementing bike sharing programs can potentially reduce transportation emissions and urban noise levels by encouraging more individuals to switch from cars to bikes. Although the impact on vehicle emissions for bike share systems alone is minimal, this solution can be combined with other approaches—such as constructing safe bicycle infrastructure—to prompt users to ditch their personal vehicles (4). Additionally, zero-emitting, electrically assisted bikes can help individuals lessen their carbon footprint by not contributing to overall urban pollution (5).",

          "description": "The construction industry is one of the highest contributors to pollution with a significant carbon footprint (1). The harmful environmental impacts from construction activities largely result from diesel emissions from construction equipment (2). Although there are regulations pertaining to construction equipment standards, outdated and high-emitting equipment is still in use. In 2019, the building and construction industries accounted for nearly 40% of global carbon emissions (3). Additionally, it is estimated that transport within construction projects accounts for approximately 10% of carbon dioxide emissions (4). \n\nFortunately, there are actions that contractors and construction companies can take to reduce their carbon footprint including: (2, 5, 6)\n-Idle-reduction practices, especially for large equipment that burns a lot of fuel\n-Using local construction materials to reduce emissions from material transport\n-Using cleaner, alternative fuels and upgrading construction equipment to reduce emissions\n\nConstruction sites can also account for a significant portion of polluted stormwater runoff, so construction site operators should ensure that the site is preserving erosion impacts and water quality throughout the duration of the project (7).\n\nConstruction-related noise pollution is another concern among construction workers since it can eventually lead to a loss of hearing and other health effects. However, there are a number of actions that construction companies can take to protect their workers and the surrounding environment (8, 9). Some of these noise controls include:\n-Choosing low-noise machinery with sound-absorbing materials\n-Implement equipment muffler requirements\n-Operate noisy machinery when fewer workers are on-site\n-Add noise barriers between the noise and the worker\n-Offer hearing protection, such as ear plugs, for workers\n-Provide quiet areas for workers during breaks\n-Incorporate complaint mechanisms for workers and the community",

This is similar to transit-oriented development practices, in which cities are designed to be more pedestrian-oriented and discourage single occupant vehicle trips by introducing car-free centers. A car-free center is a location where the population of the city center primarily uses forms of public transportation or walking in replace of car travel (2). The infrastructure of the location does not support large motor vehicle traffic and makes it difficult for drivers to get around the city, thus promoting cycling and walking (3). Vehicle restrictions can be specific to the type of vehicle, such as permitting only certain types of vehicles from entering the street.

Fleet managers and public transit operators can utilize route planning software to calculate the most efficient routes to decrease travel time, fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions (1). In addition, this can improve business operations and increase profit margins for these companies (2).\n\nMobile route planning tools can be utilized by pedestrians and bicyclists to identify the best routes, in terms of safety, trip duration, air quality, and noise levels. Convenient route planning apps can recognize routes with less exposure to air and noise pollution and offer alternatives to highly trafficked roads. Studies suggest that vulnerable road users would be willing to take alternative routes with similar travel times in order to avoid exposure to traffic-related air pollution (3).\n\nTrip planning systems assist with trip planning (both before and during the trip) by utilizing one or more modes of transportation, considering the traveler's preferences and restrictions, and efficiently integrating the desired outcomes for the traveler (4). These systems can safety and efficiently connect road users to community amenities and other destinations.",

          "description": "Parking standards, including parking maximums and minimums, refer to policy decisions regarding the amount of parking that is required for new developments during land use planning (1). Many cities have parking requirements within zoning codes that establish a minimum number of off-street parking spaces to meet the specific development's demands (2). The purpose is to ensure that there is enough off-street parking available for each development, without vehicles being forced to park in other lots and creating more traffic. \n\nAs more people have become dependent on cars, the demand for curbside or on-street parking has increased, and the solution has been to implement zoning requirements for off-street parking (3). Unfortunately, this can limit the space that is available for pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure, public transit, and green space. Parking minimums can also lead to increased local vehicle emissions and traffic noise from discouraging alternative forms of transportation and leading to urban sprawl, a form of rapid low-density development (4). Reducing minimum parking requirements and, instead, establishing parking maximums and removing off-street parking requirements can promote compact development, prevent underutilized parking lots, and can allow the land to be used for other purposes (5).",

          "description": "Compact cities refers to urban plans that are related to a much more densely populated occupancy with multiple uses (such as households, businesses, and activities) and the encouragement of pedestrian, cycling, and public transportation-user mobility (1). Development density and development mix increases physical activity by providing greater access and convenience for active and public transportation users by shortening the distance and obstructions between origins and destinations (2). This increased accessibility benefits less mobile populations and could enable them to travel independently more frequently and reduce community severance.\n\nThe compact city concept is one of several ideas for addressing comparable issues in emerging countries. In actual practices, the compact city concept is confined to densification, redistribution of density, execution of public transportation development plans, and mixed uses of land resources (3). It is built on a well-functioning public transportation system and an urban design that, according to its proponents, fosters walking and cycling, as well as minimal energy use and pollution. It is also considered a more sustainable urban settlement form than urban sprawl since it is less reliant on automobiles and hence requires less (and less expensive) infrastructure (4).",

          "description": "Tram and light rail transit (LRT) systems is a form of public transportation in cities. Although most tramways and light rail systems are powered by electricity, some are powered by diesel. Light rail differs from other forms of rail transportation (such as subways, heavy rail, and rapid transit systems) which all employ trains in many respects. The most significant distinction is that light rail frequently shares the public right-of-way with other modes of transportation. \n\nMany light rail train lines, for example, operate on public streets, sharing space with traffic. In certain circumstances, a light-rail train will travel on a designated section of the road, although it will still be subject to traffic regulations. Secondly, the system is built for speed and small loads, and it generally has relatively basic passenger carriages that are not meant for long distances (1).\n\nThe tramway and light rail transit systems employ electrically powered carts with steel wheels that are moved over a steel track. A pantograph is used to extract propulsive power from an overhead distribution grid. The tramway and light rail systems and regular automobiles share the streets in the cities, which implies that automobiles, pedestrians, and LRT all use the same area. They are built on reserved areas where automobile traffic is not allowed (2).",

Around the globe, traffic calming has established itself as a tried-and-true component of sustainable urban mobility management. Although traffic calming originated in Europe, it is now a common practice in the U.S. (3). \n\nTraffic calming measures serve several purposes, including lowering fast-moving vehicle speeds to reduce the risk of potential accidents on the road, balancing different modes of traffic due to slower speeding, minimizing noise levels, and improving air quality. They also increase safety and reduce the number of accidents, lessen the need for police enforcement, and improve accessibility for various modes of transportation (4).",

          "description": "Lowering transit fares, such as through vouchers and reimbursements, can result in greater access to healthy destinations and improve connectivity. In poor neighborhoods dependent on transit, people can experience isolation from other parts of their community or much-needed goods and services if those amenities are too far away to walk to, or if transit is too expensive (1).\nThis can include providing vouchers to a specific population which allows them to take public or private transportation for free or at a reduced cost (2). The strategy also offers mileage reimbursements to support participating members who drive their own vehicle or are unable to find friends or family to take them to their various medical emergency or non-emergency appointments (3). The target population includes those who could not access transportation due to physical disabilities, old age, a medical condition, or financial constraints. With the voucher, participants either pay less or or take a ride for free while the transportaion provider gets reimbursed by the funding sponsor. A voucher system allows users to chose transportation service to match their needs. It allows them to chose the type of vehicle, time and day, type of service (e.g. door-to-door, public buses, taxis, etc.), thereby mitigating traditional transportation barriers.",

          "description": "Land use for public transit entails implementing new land development practices and managing existing land in order to: (1)\n- Improve conditions for a good public transportation operation\n- Enable access to urban areas  \n- Encourage people to travel more by alternative modes of transportation (including biking and walking)\n- Increase availability and accessibility to transportation\n\nPublic transportation modes, such as rail and bus stations, may act as a catalyst for more accessible land use by establishing pedestrian- and cyclist-oriented areas. This is usually accomplished by arranging the site and mix of land uses to accommodate public transportation. This approach can include multimodal connection planning such as treating existing rail stations and transit stations as nodal hubs for pedestrian, bicycle, micro-mobility and other active transportation modes. It also includes mixed-use development offering non-residential services and amenities in walking distance to home, work, school and transit. Compared to other areas, community members surrounding by this form of land use will travel less by personal vehicle, thereby reducing the health effects associated with vehicle overburden. Similarly, employees in such locations are more likely to use alternative modes of transportation to go to work and do lunchtime errands on foot or by bicycle. These variables may result in more significant public transportation commuting, increased non-motorized travel for non-commuting excursions (such as shopping and school visits), and decreased vehicle travel (2).",

          "description": "In addition to aerodynamics and the interaction between the vehicle and the pavement, highway traffic noise can be caused by the vehicle itself and the type of tires (1). Therefore, low-noise vehicles and tires are potential approaches to combat noise pollution, particularly in urban environments.\n\nRegarding vehicle type, vehicles with an internal combustion engine (ICE) emit noise through engine vibrations and from the exhaust system (2). Vehicles with larger engines, such as heavy trucks, or higher speeds may emit higher levels of noise. However, electric vehicles (EVs) produce very small levels of noise, particularly at lower speeds. At higher speeds, the noise level between EVs and regular vehicles may be roughly the same due to tire noise.\n\nTire noise is associated with tread pattern, the number of tires, tire width, rubber elasticity, and other factors (1, 3). For example, tires with varied tread block sizes, less space between tread blocks, and semi-closed shoulders can help dampen noise (4). Additionally, some research has pointed to low rolling resistance tires as a solution to minimize road traffic noise (5).",

For example, the Noise Control Act of 1972 gave authority to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish noise regulations for motor vehicles and construction equipment (1, 2). It set a maximum noise level of 80 adjusted decibels (dBA) for newly manufactured medium and heavy trucks. It also required the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) to enforce these standards. \n\nIn addition, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Noise Regulation within the Code of Federal Regulations requires that state highway agencies (SHAs) conduct noise studies for various highway construction projects (3). It also contains noise abatement criteria for land use activities, where SHAs must evaluate noise barriers and other measures to reduce traffic noise. These regulations come from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 (4).",
